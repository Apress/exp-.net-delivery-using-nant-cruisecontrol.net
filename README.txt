Expert .Net Delivery - Source Code v1.0
=======================================

This archive contains the source code referred to throughout the book.
There are some important points to notice:

1) The book and code relies on the use of Visual Studio .Net (for Net 1.1), Visual SourceSafe 6.0d and SQL Server (or MSDE). These need to be installed independently of this code. It is possible to use the code without these tools, but modifications to files will be required.

2) The archive is intended to be unzipped to D:\dotNetDelivery. If this is possible then the build files in the later chapters should work without modification. If not, then some modifications to the paths will be required.

3) All of the tools required for the actual 'build' activities are included in the Tools folder. You can provide your own versions, but bear in mind that this may mean configuration changes are required. Replacing the tools with newer versions is recommended once you are familiar with the source code arrangements.

4) Some configuration, such as the addition of the NAnt executable to the PATH and the setting up of web sites is described in the book text.

5) I have tried to ensure that, as far as is possible, the code will execute 'out of the box' but inevitably with collections of scripts involving many tools, there may be some issues. I hope that any problems you experience will not decrease your enjoyment of the tools and techniques and apologise in advance for this.

6) I have left a considerable number of artifacts from the build process in the positions they are expected so that it is more obvious how things should be operating when you are reading the book. 

Please feel free to contact me with questions and feedback, or just to vent some spleen and I will help if I can!

All the best,

Marc
