			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<div class="i1">
				<p>
					log4net is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a 
					variety of output targets. In case of problems with an application, 
					it is helpful to enable logging so that the problem can be located. 
					With log4net it is possible to enable logging at runtime without 
					modifying the application binary. The log4net package is designed so 
					that log statements can remain in shipped code without incurring a 
					high performance cost. It follows that the speed of logging (or 
					rather not logging) is crucial.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the same time, log output can be so voluminous that it quickly becomes 
					overwhelming. One of the distinctive features of log4net is the notion of 
					hierarchical loggers. Using these loggers it is possible to selectively 
					control which log statements are output at arbitrary granularity. 
				</p>
				<p>
					log4net is designed with two distinct goals in mind: speed and flexibility

						<tr>
							<th>
								Type</th>
							<th>
								Description</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>log4net.Appender.ADONetAppender</td>
							<td>
								Writes logging events to a database using either prepared statements or stored 
								procedures.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>log4net.Appender.ASPNetTraceAppender</td>
							<td>
								Writes logging events to the ASP trace context. These can then be rendered at 
								the end of the ASP page or on the ASP trace page.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>log4net.Appender.ConsoleAppender</td>
							<td>
								Writes logging events to the application's Console. The events may go to either 
								the standard our stream or the standard error stream.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>log4net.Appender.EventLogAppender</td>
							<td>
								Writes logging events to the Windows Event Log.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>log4net.Appender.FileAppender</td>
							<td>
								Writes logging events to a file in the file system.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>log4net.Appender.MemoryAppender</td>
							<td>
								Stores logging events in an in memory buffer.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>log4net.Appender.NetSendAppender</td>
							<td>
								Writes logging events to the Windows Messenger service. These messages are 
								displayed in a dialog on a users terminal.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>log4net.Appender.OutputDebugStringAppender</td>
							<td>
								Writes logging events to the debugger. If the application has no 
								debugger, the system debugger displays the string. If the application has no 
								debugger and the system debugger is not active, the message is ignored.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>log4net.Appender.RemotingAppender</td>
							<td>
								Writes logging events to a remoting sink using .NET remoting.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>log4net.Appender.RollingFileAppender</td>
							<td>
								Writes logging events to a file in the file system. The RollingFileAppender can 
								be configured to log to multiple files based upon date or file size 
								constraints.

						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>log4net.Appender.SMTPAppender</td>
							<td>
								Sends logging events to an email address.

								multicast group using a UdpClient.

			<h1>Hierarchical logging architecture</h1>
			<div class="i1">
				<p>
					Hierarchical logging is an ideal fit with component based development. 
					Each component has its own of logger. When individually tested, the 
					properties of these categories may be set however the developer wishes. 
					When combined with other components, the loggers inherit the properties 
					determined by the integrator of the components. One can selectively elevate 
					logging priorities on one component without affecting the other components. 
					This is useful when you need a detailed trace from just a single component 
					without crowding the trace file with messages from other components. All 
					this can be done through configuration files; no code changes are required. 			
				</p>
			</div>
			<h1>XML Configuration</h1>
			<div class="i1">
				<p>
					log4net is configured using an XML configuration file. The configuration 
					information can be embedded within other XML configuration files
					(such as the application's .config file) or in a seperate file. The
					configuration is easily readable and updateable while retaining the
					flexiblity to express all configurations.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h1>Dynamic Configuration</h1>
			<div class="i1">
				<p>
					log4net can monitor its configuration file for changes and dynamicaly
					apply changes made by the configurator. The logging levels, appenders, 
					layouts, and just about everything else can be adjusted at runtime. 
					In many cases it is possible to diagnose application issues without 
					terminating the process in question. This can a very valuable tool in
					investigationg issues with deployed applications.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h1>Logging Context</h1>
			<div class="i1">
				<p>
					log4net can collect logging context data in a way that is transparent 
					to the developer at the point of logging. The NDC (Nested Diagnostic Context) 
					and the MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) capture contextual data and attach
					it to logging messages. For instance, in a web service, the 
					authentication ID of the caller is stored in the MDC once the caller is 
					authenticated. This ID is then logged as part of each logging message
					automaticaly.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h1>Proven architecture</h1>
			<div class="i1">
				<p>
					log4net is based on the highly successfull log4j logging library,
					in development since 1996. This popular and proven architecture has 
					so far been ported to 12 languages.
