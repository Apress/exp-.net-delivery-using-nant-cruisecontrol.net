				<h3><a id="whatIs">What is log4net?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						log4net is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of 
						output targets.
					</p>
					<p>
						In case of problems with an application, it is helpful to enable logging so 
						that the problem can be located. With log4net it is possible to enable logging at 
						runtime without modifying the application binary. The log4net package is designed 
						so that log statements can remain in <i>shipped</i> code without incurring a 
						high performance cost. It follows that the speed of logging (or rather not 
						logging) is crutial.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the same time, log output can be so voluminous that it quickly becomes 
						overwhelming. One of the distinctive features of log4net is the notion of <i>hierarchical 
						loggers</i>. Using these loggers it is possible to selectively control 
						which log statements are output at arbitrary granularity.
					</p>
					<p>
						log4net is designed with two distinct goals in mind: speed and flexibility. There 
						is a tight balance between these two requirements.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="reliable">Is log4net a reliable logging system?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						No. log4net is not reliable. It is a best-effort and <em>fail-stop</em> logging system.
					</p>
					<p>
						By fail-stop, we mean that log4net will not throw unexpected exceptions at 
						run-time potentially causing your application to crash. <b>If for any reason, log4net 
						throws an uncaught exception</b> (except for <span class="code">ArgumentException</span> and 
						<span class="code">ArgumentNullException</span> which may be thrown), <b>please send an email 
						to the <a href="mailto:log4net-users@lists.sourceforge.net">
						log4net-users@lists.sourceforge.net</a> mailing list</b>. Uncaught exceptions 
						are handled as serious bugs requiring immediate attention.
					</p>
					<p>
						Moreover, log4net will not revert to <span class="code">System.Console.Out</span>
						or <span class="code">System.Console.Error</span> when its designated 
						output stream is not opened, is not writable or becomes full. This avoids 
						corrupting an otherwise working program by flooding the user's terminal because 
						logging fails. However, log4net will output a single message to 
						<span class="code">System.Console.Error</span> indicating that logging can not be performed.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="prerequisites">What are the prerequisites for log4net?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						log4net runs on many different frameworks and each framework has its own requirements.
						As a rule of thumb you will need an ECMA-335 compliant CLI runtime, for example, 
						the Microsoft .NET runtime 1.0 (1.0.3705) or 1.1 (1.1.4322).
					</p>
					<p>
						Not all frameworks are created equal and some features have been excluded from 
						some of the builds. See the <a href="framework-support.html">Framework Support</a> 
						document for more information.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="usageExample">Is there example code for using log4net?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						There is a directory containing examples in <span class="code">log4net\examples</span>. 
						The examples are broken down by framework.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="features">What are the features of log4net?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<ul>
						<li>
							log4net is optimized for speed.</li>
						<li>
							log4net is based on a named logger hierarchy.</li>
						<li>

				<h3><a id="thread-safety">Is log4net thread-safe?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						Yes, log4net is thread-safe.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="sample">What does log output look like?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						The log output can be customized in many ways. Moreover, one can completely 
						override the output format by implementing one's own <span class="code">ILayout</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						Here is an example output using <span class="code">PatternLayout</span> with the conversion 
						pattern <span class="code">%r [%t] %-5p %c{2} %x - %m%n</span>
					</p>
					<pre class="code">
176 [main] INFO  examples.Sort - Populating an array of 2 elements in reverse order.
225 [main] INFO  examples.SortAlgo - Entered the sort method.
262 [main] DEBUG SortAlgo.OUTER i=1 - Outer loop.
276 [main] DEBUG SortAlgo.SWAP i=1 j=0 - Swapping intArray[0] = 1 and intArray[1] = 0
290 [main] DEBUG SortAlgo.OUTER i=0 - Outer loop.
304 [main] INFO  SortAlgo.DUMP - Dump of integer array:
317 [main] INFO  SortAlgo.DUMP - Element [0] = 0
331 [main] INFO  SortAlgo.DUMP - Element [1] = 1
343 [main] INFO  examples.Sort - The next log statement should be an error message.
346 [main] ERROR SortAlgo.DUMP - Tried to dump an uninitialized array.
467 [main] INFO  examples.Sort - Exiting main method.
					</pre>
					<p>
						The first field is the number of milliseconds elapsed since the start of the 
						program. The second field is the thread outputting the log statement. The third 
						field is the level of the log statement. The fourth field is the rightmost 
						two components of the name of the logger making the log request. The fifth field (just 
						before the '-') is the <em>nested diagnostic context</em> (<span class="code">NDC</span>). Note the 
						nested diagnostic context may be empty as in the first two statements. The text 
						after the '-' is the message of the statement.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="logger">What are <em>Loggers</em>?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						The notion of loggers lies at the heart of log4net's configuration. Loggers define a 
						hierarchy and give the programmer <em>run-time</em> control on which statements 
						are printed or not.
					</p>
					<p>
						Loggers are assigned levels through the configuration of log4net. A log statement is 
						routed through to the appender depending on its level <em>and</em> its logger.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="behaviour">How can I change log behaviour at runtime?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						Logging behaviour can be set using configuration files which are parsed at runtime. 
						Using configuration files the programmer can define loggers and set their 
						levels.
					</p>
					<p>
						Configuration files are specified in XML. See <span class="code">log4net.Config.DOMConfigurator</span>
						for more details.
					</p>
					<p>
						See the various <span class="code">log4net.Layout</span> and <span class="code">log4net.Appender</span>
						components for specific configuration options.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="disableLogging">How do I completely disable all logging at runtime?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						Setting the <span class="code">Threshold</span> on the Hierarchy to Level OFF will disable all
						logging from that Hierarchy. This can be done in the log4net configuration file
						by setting the "threshold" attribute on the log4net configuration element to "OFF".
						For example:
					</p>
					<pre class="code">
&lt;log4net threshold="OFF" /&gt;
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="fastLogging">What is the fastest way of (not) logging?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						For some logger <span class="code">log</span>, writing,
					</p>
					<pre class="code">
log.Debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + entry[i]);
					</pre>
					<p>
						incurs the cost of constructing the message parameter, that is converting both 
						integer <span class="code">i</span> and <span class="code">entry[i]</span> to 
						a string, and concatenating intermediate strings. This, regardless of whether 
						the message will be logged or not.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are worried about speed, then write
					</p>
					<pre class="code">
if(log.IsDebugEnabled) 
{
	log.Debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + entry[i]);
}
					</pre>
					<p>
						This way you will not incur the cost of parameter construction if debugging is 
						disabled for logger <span class="code">log</span>. On the other hand, if the logger is 
						debug enabled, you will incur the cost of evaluating whether the logger is 
						enabled or not, twice: once in <span class="code">IsDebugEnabled</span> and once in <span class="code">Debug</span>. 
						This is an insignificant overhead since evaluating a logger takes less than 
						1% of the time it takes to actually log a statement.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="fasterfasterLogging">What is REALLY the FASTEST way of (not) logging?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						So you don't think that the previous FAQ is really the fastest way
						of not logging? Well there is a faster way but it does have some
						drawbacks. Starting from: 
					</p>
					<pre class="code">
if(log.IsDebugEnabled) 
{
	log.Debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + entry[i]);
}
					</pre>
					<p>
						It is possible to further eliminate the calls to <span class="code">IsDebugEnabled</span>
						so that the call is only made once per logger. If you are using one logger 
						for each class then you can store the enabled state for the logger in a static
						variable in the class and then test against this variable:
					</p>
					<pre class="code">
public class FastLogger
{
	private static readonly ILog log = LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(FastLogger));
	private static readonly bool isDebugEnabled = log.IsDebugEnabled;

	public void MyMethod()
	{
		if(isDebugEnabled) 
		{
			log.Debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + entry[i]);
		}
	}
}
					</pre>
					<p>
						So why exactly is this faster? Well to start with the <span class="code">IsDebugEnabled</span>
						is not called for each log statement, it is called once per logger. Furthermore as the
						<span class="code">isDebugEnabled</span> variable is <span class="code">private static readonly</span>
						the JIT compiler can at <em>run-time</em> optimise out the <span class="code">if</span> test altogether. This means that
						at runtime the JIT compiler won't even compile the logging statements into native code, i.e.
						all the logging just disappears.
					</p>
					<p>
						So what is the downside to using this? Well one of the clever features of log4net is that
						you can change the logging configuration while your program is running. If you need to 
						investigate an issue in your application, you don't have to stop the application, setup the
						logging and restart the application, you can change the logging configuration and the
						log4net will reload it (see <span class="code">ConfigureAndWatch</span> APIs for more 
						information). However if the JIT has compiled out all of the logging statements
						then they are gone and you can't get them back by reloading the configuration file. Effectively
						this means that the logging configuration can only be set when the application loads and
						it cannot be changed at runtime. It is up to you to decide if you need ultimate speed or need
						to be able to reload the logging configuration while the application is running.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="namingLoggers">Are there any suggested ways for naming loggers?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						Yes, there are.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can name logging loggers by <strong>locality</strong>. It turns out that 
						instantiating a logger in each class, with the logger name equal to the 
						fully-qualified name of the class, is a useful and straightforward approach of 
						defining loggers. This approach has many benefits:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							It is very simple to implement.</li>
						<li>
							It is very simple to explain to new developers.</li>
						<li>
							It automatically mirrors your application's own modular design.</li>
						<li>
							It can be further refined at will.</li>
						<li>
							Printing the logger automatically gives information on the locality of the 
							log statement.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						However, this is not the only way for naming loggers. A common alternative 
						is to name loggers by <strong>functional areas</strong>. For example, the 
						"database" logger, "remoting" logger, "security" logger, or the "XML" 
						logger.
					</p>
					<p>
						You may choose to name loggers by functionality and subcategorize by 
						locality, as in "DATABASE.MyApp.MyClass" or 
						"DATABASE.MyApp.MyModule.MyOtherClass".
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>You are totally free in choosing the names of your loggers.</em> The 
						log4net package merely allows you to manage your names in a hierarchy. However, 
						it is your responsibility to define this hierarchy.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Note:</b> by naming loggers by locality one tends to name things by 
						functionality, since in most cases the locality relates closely to 
						functionality.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="className">How do I get the fully-qualified name of a class in a static block?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						You can easily retrieve the fully-qualified name of a class in a static block 
						for class <span class="code">X</span>, with the statement <span class="code">typeof(X).Name</span>. 
						Note that <span class="code">X</span> is the class name and span an instance.
						However because the <span class="code">LogManager.GetLogger</span> method is overloaded
						to take an instance of <span class="code">Type</span> as well as <span class="code">string</span>
						usually only the type of the class is required.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here is the suggested usage template:
					</p>
					<pre class="code">
public class Foo
{
	private static readonly ILog log = LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(Foo));
	... other code
}
					</pre>
					<p>
						An equivalent and more portable solution, though slightly longer, is to use the declaring type 
						of the static constructor.
					</p>
					<pre class="code">
public class Foo
{
	private static readonly ILog log = LogManager.GetLogger(System.Reflection.MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod().DeclaringType);
	... other code
}
					</pre>
					<p>
						<b>Note:</b> the .NET Compact Framework 1.0 does not support <span class="code">System.Reflection.MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod()</span>.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="customLayouts">Can the log output format be customized?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						Yes. You can implement the <span class="code">ILayout</span> interface to 
						create you own customized log format, or you can extend the 
						<span class="code">LayoutSkeleton</span> class which provides a default
						implementation of the <span class="code">ILayout</span> interface.
						Appenders can be parameterized to use the layout of your choice.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="NDC">Can the outputs of multiple client request go to different log files?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						Many developers are confronted with the problem of distinguishing the log 
						output originating from the same class but different client requests. They come 
						up with ingenious mechanisms to fan out the log output to different files. In 
						most cases, this is not the right approach.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is simpler to use a nested diagnostic context (<span class="code">NDC</span>). 
						Typically, one would <span class="code">NDC.Push()</span>
						client specific information, such as the client's hostname, ID or any other 
						distinguishing information when starting to handle the client's request. 
						Thereafter, log output will automatically include the nested diagnostic context 
						so that you can distinguish logs from different client requests even if they 
						are output to the same file.
					</p>
					<p>
						See the <span class="code">NDC</span> and the <span class="code">PatternLayout</span> classes for more 
						information.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="options">What are the configurable options for an appender?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						log4net uses public properties to configure components such as
						Appenders, Layouts, Loggers etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						Thus, any writable public property in on the appender corresponds to a 
						configurable option. For example, in <span class="code">RollingFileAppender</span> the 
						<span class="code">public int MaxSizeRollBackups { set; }</span> property corresponds to 
						the <span class="code">MaxSizeRollBackups</span> option.
					</p>
					<p>
						Layouts options are also defined by their writable properties. Same goes for most 
						other log4net components. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="rm">Logger instances seem to be create only. Why isn't there a method to remove logger instances?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						It is quite nontrivial to define the semantics of a "removed" logger which is 
						still referenced by the user.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="filterByLevel">Is it possible to direct log output to different appenders by level?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						Yes it is. Setting the <span class="code">Threshold</span> option of any appender extending 
						<span class="code">AppenderSkeleton</span>, (most log4net appenders extend 
						<span class="code">AppenderSkeleton</span>) will filter out all log events 
						with a <em>lower</em> level than the value of the threshold option.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, setting the threshold of an appender to DEBUG will also allow INFO, 
						WARN, ERROR and FATAL messages to log along with DEBUG messages. (DEBUG is the 
						lowest level). This is usually acceptable as there is little use for DEBUG 
						messages without the surrounding INFO, WARN, ERROR and FATAL messages. 
						Similarly, setting the threshold of an appender to ERROR will filter out DEBUG, 
						INFO and ERROR messages but not FATAL messages.
					</p>
					<p>
						This policy usually best encapsulates what the user actually wants to do, as 
						opposed to her mind-projected solution.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="multiProcess">How do I get multiple process to log to the same file?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						The <span class="code">FileAppender</span> holds a write lock on the log
						file while it is logging. This prevents other processes from writing to the
						file, therefore it is not possible to have multiple processes log directly 
						to the same log file, even if they are on the same machine.
					</p>
					<p>
						You may have each process log to a <span class="code">RemotingAppender</span>. 
						The receiving <span class="code">RemoteLoggingServerPlugin</span> (or 
						<span class="code">IRemoteLoggingSink</span>) can receive all the events and 
						send them to a single log file.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>


				<h3><a id="timestamp">If I have many processes across multiple hosts (possibly across multiple time zones) logging to the same file using the method above, what happens to timestamps?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						The timestamp is created when the logging event is created. That is so say, 
						when the <span class="code">Debug</span>, <span class="code">Info</span>, 
						<span class="code">Warn</span>, <span class="code">Error</span>
						or <span class="code">Fatal</span> method is invoked. This is unaffected by the time at 
						which they may arrive at a remote server. Since the timestamps are 
						stored in UTC format inside the event, they all appear in the same time zone as 
						the host creating the logfile. Since the clocks of various machines may not be

				<h3><a id="tax">Why should I donate my extensions to log4net back to the project?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						Contrary to the GNU Public License (GPL) the Apache Software License does not 
						make any claims over your extensions. By extensions, we mean totally new code 
						that invokes existing log4net classes. <em>You are free to do whatever you wish with 
						your proprietary log4net extensions.</em> In particular, you may choose to 
						never release your extensions to the wider public.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are very careful not to change the log4net client API so that newer log4net 
						releases are backward compatible with previous versions. We are a lot less 
						scrupulous with the internal log4net API. Thus, if your extension is designed to 
						work with log4net version <span class="code">n</span>, then when log4net release version <span class="code">n+1</span>
						comes out, you will probably need to adapt your proprietary extensions to the 
						new release. Thus, you will be forced to spend precious resources in order to 
						keep up with log4net changes. This is commonly referred to as the "stupid-tax". 
						By donating the code and making it part of the standard distribution, you save 
						yourself the unnecessary maintenance work.
					</p>
					<p>
						If your extensions are useful then someone will eventually write an extension 
						providing the same or very similar functionality. Your development effort will 
						be wasted.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unless the proprietary log4net extension is business critical, there is little 
						reason for not donating your extensions back to the project.

				<h3><a id="internalDebug">How do I enable log4net internal debugging?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						There are several different ways to enable internal debugging in log4net.
						These different methods are listed below. The prefered method is to sepcify
						the <span class="code">log4net.Internal.Debug</span> option in the application's
						config file.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								To enable log4net's internal debug programmatically you need
								to set the <span class="code">log4net.helpers.LogLog.InternalDebugging</span>
								property to <span class="code">true</span>. Obviously the sooner this
								is set the more debug will be produced.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Internal debugging can also be enabled by setting a value in the application's
								configuration file (not the log4net configuration file, unless the log4net config
								data is embeded in the application's config file). The <span class="code">log4net.Internal.Debug</span>
								application setting must be set to the value <span class="code">true</span>.
								For example:
							</p>
							<pre class="code">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
	&lt;appSettings&gt;
		&lt;add key="log4net.Internal.Debug" value="true"/&gt;
	&lt;/appSettings&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
							</pre>
							<p>
								This setting is read immediatly on startup an will cause all internal
								debugging messages to be emmitted.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								To enable internal debugging from a configuration file, the 
								<span class="code">debug</span> attribute on the log4net
								configuration element can be set to the value <span class="code">true</span>. 
								For example:
							</p>
							<pre class="code">
&lt;log4net debug="true"&gt;

	... configuration ...
	
&lt;/log4net&gt;
							</pre>
							<p>
								Using this method does require that your configuration file is located
								and loaded, otherwise the attribute will not be read. If you need to
								debug the process of locating the configuration file then use one of the other
								methods for enabling debugging.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Internal debugging messages are witten to the console and to the 
						<span class="code">System.Diagnostics.Trace</span>
						system. If the application does not have a console the messages logged
						there will be lost. Note that an application can redirect the console
						stream by setting the <span class="code">System.Console.Out</span>. The
						Trace system will by default send the message to an attached debugger
						(where the messages will appear in the output window). If the process
						does not have a debugger attached then the messages are sent to the 
						system debugger. A utility like DebugView from 
						<a href="http://www.sysinternals.com">http://www.sysinternals.com</a>
						may be used to capture these messages.

				<h3><a id="trouble-EventLog">Why doesn't the EventLogAppender work?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						If you are not getting events delivered to the event log this usually indicates 
						a permissions problem. Basically if the event log does not exist the EventLogAppender 
						tries to create it, but you need local administrator permissions to create event logs 
						(just to write into the right bit of the registry). You don't need administrator 
						permissions to log to an existing event log, but it must exist. If you are using the 
						event log from a web application or service using the event log can be a little tricky. 
					</p>
					<p>
						A web application will run as the user account ASPNET. This account deliberately has 
						few permissions to reduce the chances of someone hacking into the web server. While the 
						account has permission to write to the event log it does not have permission to create 
						event sources (registry create and write access), which are needed to write to the event log.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are a couple of solutions:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								Make the ASPNET user a member of the Administrators group. This will work because the 
								user will then have the required permissions. This is not recommended for production use.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								As the event source only needs to be created once for the machine, create an installer
								and configure it to create the event source. 
								The installer will need to be run as Administrator (don't they all). See 
								<span class="code">System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller</span> in the Microsoft .NET 
								Framework SDK for an example of how to create a simple event log installer.
							</p>
						</li>

				<h3><a id="trouble-ASPNET-File">Why can't I log to a FileAppender from a web application?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						The web application runs as a special user account on the web server
						called ASPNET. This account has restricted permissions to protect the 
						web server from attacks. By default this account may not have permission
						to write to the file system. Make sure that the ASPNET account has 
						permission to create and write to files in the directory chosen for
						logging.

				<h3><a id="troub-Service">Why doesn't the logging in my service work?</a></h3>
				<div class="i1">
					<p>
						A windows service runs as a user account specified in the services
						control panel. This account may have restricted permissions, make 
						sure that the account has permission to create and write to files 
						in the directory chosen for logging.
					</p>
					<p>
						A windows service is launched by windows. The current directory in
						a service is set to the windows system directory (e.g. 
						<span class="code">C:\Windows\System32</span>). If you are loading
						the configuration file from the current directory then be aware
						that this path will not be the location of your assemblies.
						The best way to get the path to your assemblies is to use
						<span class="code">AppDomain.BaseDirectory</span>.
						Note that the log4net internals never use the current directory.
