	' Example of how to simply configure and use log4net in a .NET Compact Framework
	' application.
	'
	' The .NET Compact Framework does not support retrieving assembly-level
	' attributes, therefor log4net must be configured by code.
	'
	' The .NET Compact Framework does not support hooking up the <c>AppDomain.ProcessExit</c>
	' and <c>AppDomain.DomainUnload</c> events, so log4net must be shutdown manually to 
	' free all resources.

		' Application entry point.
		Public Shared Sub Main() 
			' Uncomment the next line to enable log4net internal debugging
			' log4net.helpers.LogLog.InternalDebugging = true;

			' This will instruct log4net to look for a configuration file
			' called ConsoleApp.exe.config in the application base
			' directory (i.e. the directory containing ConsoleApp.exe)
			log4net.Config.DOMConfigurator.Configure()

			' Create a logger
			Dim log As ILog = LogManager.GetLogger(GetType(EntryPoint))

			' Log an info level message
			If log.IsInfoEnabled Then log.Info("Application [ConsoleApp] Start")

			' Invoke shared LogEvents method on LoggingExample class
			LoggingExample.LogEvents()

			Console.Write("Press Enter to exit...")
			Console.ReadLine()

			If log.IsInfoEnabled Then log.Info("Application [ConsoleApp] Stop")

			' It's not possible to use shutdown hooks in the .NET Compact Framework,
			' so you have manually shutdown log4net to free all resoures.
