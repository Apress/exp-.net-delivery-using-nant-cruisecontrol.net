				    <p class="paragraph">The Web Dashboard provides reporting features to replace those in the <a href="Project Report Web Application.html" title="Project Report Web Application">Project Report Web Application</a>. In later versions of CruiseControl.NET the old <a href="Project Report Web Application.html" title="Project Report Web Application">Project Report Web Application</a> will be deprecated and then deleted in favour of the improved <a href="Web Dashboard.html" title="Web Dashboard">Web Dashboard</a>.</p>Benefits of the Web Dashboard over the old <a href="Project Report Web Application.html" title="Project Report Web Application">Project Report Web Application</a> are:<br/>

<ul class="star">
<li> Multi-project, multi-server support - 1 Web Dashboard deployment can report over all the CCNet projects in your organisation so there is no longer a need for multiple instances of a web application.</li>
<li> New plugin API supports custom features at various groupings of report, project, etc.</li>
<li> New plugin API supports a complete code interface, enabling significantly richer plugins</li>
<li> (To come) Configuration Plugins to support remote, GUI based, server configuration</li>
</ul>

Dashboard reporting features are still <b class="strong">in development</b>. The UI is not completely polished and the API for developing custom plugins is not stabilised.
</td></tr></table></div></div><p class="paragraph">These new reporting features are being used on CCNetLive at <a href="http://ccnetlive.thoughtworks.com/ccnet/" title="Visit page outside Confluence">&#104;ttp://ccnetlive.thoughtworks.com/ccnet/</a></p><h3 class="heading3"><a name="WebDashboardReportingFeatures-Setupguide"> Setup guide</a></h3><p class="paragraph">To install the new Web Dashboard features, do the following:
<ul class="star">
<li> Run through the instructions on the <a href="Web Dashboard.html" title="Web Dashboard">Web Dashboard</a> page.</li>
<li> Create a folder under the WebDashboard folder called <tt class="monospaced">projectcache</tt></li>
<li> Give all rights, apart from &#039;Full Control&#039;, to the ASP.NET Machine Account to the <tt class="monospaced">projectcache</tt> folder (Normally this account is called ASPNET).  (We plan on improving the security of the design of this solution at a later date)</li>
</ul><br/>
The Web Dashboard comes pre-configured to use a default set of plugins. To change what plugins you want to use for your CruiseControl.NET deployment, edit the <tt class="monospaced">web.config</tt> file in the Dashboard&#039;s root directory and update the relevant sub-sections of the <tt class="monospaced">CCNet</tt> section.</p>If you are interested in writing your own Dashboard plugins, read <a href="Developing Web Dashboard Plugins.html" title="Developing Web Dashboard Plugins">Developing Web Dashboard Plugins</a>.<p class="paragraph">If you want to include a plugin that is not located in the Dashboard&#039;s own assembly, add an attribute called <tt class="monospaced">assemblyFileName</tt> and set the value to be the file name of the DLL that contains the plugin. This DLL must be located in the <tt class="monospaced">bin</tt> folder of the Dashboard application.</p><div align='center'><div class='informationMacroPadding'><table cellpadding='5' width='85%' cellspacing='0' class='warningMacro' border='0'><tr><td width='16' valign='top'><img src="/images/icons/emoticons/forbidden.png" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"></td><td>
Be <b class="strong">very</b> careful if enabling any Configuration Plugins - these can able any user of the web application to change project configuration in a way that could damage the machine that the build server is installed on.
</td></tr></table></div></div><p class="paragraph"><h3 class="heading3"><a name="WebDashboardReportingFeatures-ProjectSetupguide"> Project Setup guide</a></h3></p>At the moment you need to update the configuration for the Servers want to report on to point to an appropriate URL in the Web Dashboard. This will simplified in a later release.<p class="paragraph">For each project, on each server, update the <tt class="monospaced">&lt;webURL&gt;</tt> tag. The format of the URL should be the following:</p><ul class="star">
<li> <tt class="monospaced">&lt;webURL&gt;http://<em class="emphasis">hostname</em>/<em class="emphasis">VirtualDirectory</em>/Controller.aspx?&#95;action&#95;ViewProjectReport=true&amp;server=<em class="emphasis">Server Name</em>&amp;project=<em class="emphasis">Project Name</em>&lt;/webURL&gt;</tt></li>
</ul><br/>
where:<br/>

<ul class="star">
<li> <em class="emphasis">Server Name</em> is the name of the server that you set in the &lt;servers&gt; section of the &#039;web.config&#039; file for the dashboard application. If you didn&#039;t set update this file, it will just be <em class="emphasis">local</em></li>
<li> <em class="emphasis">Project Name</em> is the same as the name that you set for the project in the config file</li>
<li> In both of the above, make sure to set CAPITALS correctly, and replace any spaces in server and project names with <b class="strong"><tt class="monospaced">%20</tt></b>.</li>
<li> The ampersands should be XML escaped, ie &amp; a m p ;</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading3"><a name="WebDashboardReportingFeatures-UsageGuide"> Usage Guide</a></h3><p class="paragraph">Assuming you&#039;ve set everything up OK, you should be able to view the default page in the Virtual Directory you setup for your web application. The default page on CCNetLive is at <a href="http://ccnetlive.thoughtworks.com/ccnet/" title="Visit page outside Confluence">&#104;ttp://ccnetlive.thoughtworks.com/ccnet/</a>, and you should see something similar.</p>What you are seeing here is the <em class="emphasis">Farm View</em>. There are 4 different views in the CCNet Web Application, with increasingly narrower scope. Here&#039;s a brief description:
<ul class="star">
<li> <b class="strong">Farm</b> - shows all projects running on all servers. Drill down into a project by clicking on its name</li>
<li> <b class="strong">Server</b> - shows all projects running on a server. From here you can also view the &#039;server log&#039; (and later on add projects to a server)</li>
<li> <b class="strong">Project</b> - Shows a summary of the current state of a project, shows the recent builds, and allows project configuration (to come later.) Drill down into a specific build by clicking on its name</li>
<li> <b class="strong">Build</b> - This is the equivalent of the old CCNet <a href="Project Report Web Application.html" title="Project Report Web Application">Project Report Web Application</a>. Here you can view the results of a build in various ways (summary report, full log, FxCop results, etc.)</li>
</ul>
